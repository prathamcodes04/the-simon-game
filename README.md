A classic Simon memory game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Test your memory by repeating the sequence of colors!

🎮 How to Play
Press any key to start the game.

Simon will give a sequence of colors (e.g., Red → Blue → Green).

Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.

If correct, the game continues with a longer sequence.

If wrong, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing any key.
